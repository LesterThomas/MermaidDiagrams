Did you know you can create diagrams, sequence diagrams etc through text directly in GitHub markdown using (mermaidjs)[https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams]?

For example, here is a simple flow chart:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
